# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rake db:seed (or created alongside the db with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   cities = City.create([{ name: 'Chicago' }, { name: 'Copenhagen' }])
#   Mayor.create(name: 'Emanuel', city: cities.first)

# stu1 = Student.create(first_name: Jonathan, last_name: Doe)
# stu2 = Student.create(Bill, Clinton)
# stu3 = Student.create(Joe, Biden)
# stu4 = Student.create(Barack, Obama)


# Student.destroy_all
